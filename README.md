# Concordance
Main idea: code written in Python that tackles a version of concordance known as keyword in context. 
Note: This project was completed as an assignment requirement for UVic's SENG-265. The below 'explanation' has been provided from Dr. Michael Zastre's assignment description.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines a concordance is an “alphabeticalarrangement of principal words contained in a book, with citations of the passagesin which they occur”. Someone using a concordance is therefore able to look up aword of interest to them for that book, and find all the locations (page numbers andline numbers) where the word is used
